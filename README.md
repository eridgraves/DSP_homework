HW Set 1: Discrete convolution, filter coefficient calculation, plotting filter magnitude and phase.
HW Set 2: Plotting magnitude and phase from transfer function.
HW Set 3: Sampled vs. Continuous signals.
HW Set 4: DTFT Filter magnitude and phase response.
HW Set 5: Transversal adaptive filter via LMS algorithm, and plotting error.
HW Set 6: Direct computation of convolution vs. conversion via FFT and multiplication. Graphing complexities.
HW Set 7: Magnitudes of N-Point DFTs when passed through nonlinearities. 
HW Set 8: FIR and IIR Inverse Filters, and error calculations.
HW Set 9: 1-D Kalman Filter and evaluation using ground truth data.
